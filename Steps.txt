Travis created repository
Add each person as collaborators to work on the project directly
Each person needs to clone and pull from repository as changes are made
Push changes to repository as you make them


As collaborators you only need to do four things after a change:


Git pull, Do this to make sure you have the current version
Git add fileName, add a file to the commit 
Git commit -m “commit message”, commit changes with a message
Git push, push changes to the repository
